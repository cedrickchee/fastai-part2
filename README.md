# fast.ai "Practical Deep Learning for Coders Part 2" Course

For an introduction to the second part of the course, you can read more about it from fast.ai blog post [here](http://www.fast.ai/2017/01/17/curriculum2/)

Part 2 of the course focused on learning recent advances in deep learning and classic machine learning like clustering.

This repo contains the version of my codes for the course assignments.

I have fixed quite a number of bugs that prevent the jupyter notebook from running successfully.
